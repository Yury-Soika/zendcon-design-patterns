Iterator
========

Definition
----------

The [iterator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator) pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.

Scenario
--------

We want to implement the [Fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) series of numbers using the Iterator pattern.
